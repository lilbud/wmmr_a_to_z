Every September, the radio station 93.3 WMMR in Philadelphia does a thing where to commerate the start of school, they play every song in their catalog in alphabetical order. Usually lasting a week or two during September. This year (2024) was the longest yet at 19 days and over 3k songs.

I wanted to try and catalog this list. I figured on grabbing the song list from WMMRs site, but the full list isn't published. They keep a day or two on their "recently played" page, then it disappears. Considering I didn't have this idea fully until last week, I was a bit late.

Luckily, I found a site called [TuneGenie](https://wmmr.tunegenie.com), which keeps a nearly full archive of all the songs played. Probably as complete as I can hope to get unless WMMR publishes their list.

## Why do this?

I was interested in the statistics of how many songs would be played. I think it might've been the realization how long the 'T' section would go considering they count songs with 'The' as 'T' (rather than the word after). As well as a breakdown of how many songs each day, and how many times an artist was represented.

This data is being provided as-is, as both a PostgreSQL database dump file, as well as a series of CSV files. Probably a better way to do it, but its nearly 2am at time of writing.
